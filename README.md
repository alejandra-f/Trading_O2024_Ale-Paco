#  Microstructure Project
 
### Overview
This project explores a stock microstructure pricing model using the Erlang distribution to simulate stock price behavior. It calculates expected revenues under various trading scenarios (liquidity trades and informed trades) and determines the optimal Bid and Ask prices using Copeland and Galai’s model. The project also provides visualizations to compare revenue outcomes.

### Features
- Erlang distribution for stock price simulation.
- Expected revenue calculation for liquidity and informed trades.
- Bid/Ask spread calculation using Copeland & Galai’s model.
- Visualizations of stock price distributions and expected revenues.
