#  Generative Adversarial Networks(GAN)

## Overview
This project explores the application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for generating realistic synthetic data. 
By training and validating the GAN model on historical data, we aimed to understand the capabilities and limitations of GANs in 
generating high-quality data for various applications such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation for trading strategies.

## Objectives
- To structure a Python project following best practices.

- To utilize a training and validation dataset for optimizing and testing the GAN model.

- To implement and analyze the performance of the GAN model in generating synthetic data.

- To explore potential applications of the generated data in fields such as data augmentation and synthetic data generation.

- To evaluate the quality of the generated data using quantitative metrics and visual inspections.

## Key Findings
- Model Performance: The GAN model, composed of a generator and a discriminator, successfully learned to generate realistic
synthetic data after training.
- Quality of Generated Data: The synthetic data generated by the GAN closely resembled the real data, as evidenced by visual
inspection and performance metrics.
- Optimization and Stability: The training process highlighted the importance of balancing the training of the generator and discriminator
to avoid issues such as mode collapse or overfitting
